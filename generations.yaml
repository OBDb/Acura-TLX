    description: "The first generation TLX replaced both the TL and TSX in Acura's lineup, offering a sport sedan that bridged the gap between the two previous models. Engine options included a 2.4L four-cylinder with 206 HP paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, or a 3.5L V6 with 290 HP paired with a 9-speed automatic. The V6 model was available with Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system. A facelift in 2018 updated the exterior styling to incorporate Acura's diamond pentagon grille."
