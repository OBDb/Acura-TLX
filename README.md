This repository contains signal set configurations for the Acura TLX, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Acura TLX.

## Generations

The Acura TLX has gone through two main generations since its introduction in 2015:

- **First Generation (2015-2020)**: The TLX debuted as Acura's mid-size luxury sedan, replacing both the TL and TSX models. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated 4-cylinder producing 206 hp, and a 3.5L V6 producing 290 hp. The V6 model was available with Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system. The first generation featured Acura's signature "beak" grille design and was positioned as a sporty alternative in the luxury sedan segment. A mid-cycle refresh in 2018 brought updated styling, improved infotainment system, and the addition of the Acura Precision Concept-inspired design language.

- **Second Generation (2021-present)**: The second-generation TLX represents a complete redesign built on Acura's new platform shared with the MDX. It features more aggressive styling inspired by the Type S Concept, with a wider stance and more muscular proportions. The base model uses a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 272 hp, while the range-topping TLX Type S is powered by a 3.0L turbocharged V6 producing 355 hp. The second generation introduced a new double-wishbone front suspension setup and is available with SH-AWD as standard on Type S and optional on other trims. Enhanced technology features include a 10.2-inch infotainment display and improved driver assistance systems. [[Acura TLX Official Page]](https://www.acura.com/tlx)
